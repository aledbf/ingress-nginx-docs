  A brand new site!

Welcome to the new ingress-nginx website!

We have implemented a new website, to enable new functionality that we are hoping to take advantage:

- Ability to support multiple languages
- Able to write documentation for new features, but keep them hidden until they are released.
- Search!
- Easy access to older versions of the documentation

Big thanks to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for being the static site generator, and the [docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) team
